        <h2>Summary</h2>
        <p>Over the years I have worked many different jobs and find this to have been invaluable in my personal and professional development,
            teaching me adaptibility and a variety of skills. The majority of my time has been spent working in schools as a Primary School Teacher and then
            as a Higher Level Teaching Assistant. Last year I decided to change paths and my current role has led me to discover a new
            interest in Web Development. I am excited to see where this new adventure will take me.
