<h1>About Me</h1>

<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Hello there. My name is Louisa Scott. I was born in Broughty Ferry, Dundee and moved to Sheffield with my family when I was 11.
  I studied Primary Teaching at Sheffield Hallam University and worked as a teacher and a HLTA until July 2023.
  I started a new job at FindAUniversity the same month and I am really enjoying the change. I am
  currently studying a Udemy Course to become a full stack web developer which is exciting. Hopefully 
  this will lead to an exciting new career.
</p>
<h2>Hobbies</h2>
<p>I have many hobbies and love to try new things all the time. <br>My main passions are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Cooking - cooking relaxes me and I can spend hours in the kitchen experimenting with different foods and flavours. My favourite food is sushi.</li>
  <li>Swimming - I love wild swimming and can often be found in a river or lake, come sun or snow.</li>
  <li>Hiking - Getting out in the nature clears the cobwebs and I am so lucky to live next to the Peak District which I try to get out and explore as much as I can</li>
</ul>
<p>I am also learning Spanish and the keyboard and I occasionally like to do some art. I am also partial to a good craft beer.</p>
